          <h2>1. Realising you are alone</h2>
        </header>

        <p>
          You lie in bed feeling lonely a friday night after having drinks with your friends. You are suddently hit with the feeling that "Dang! This bed would be so much better shared with a loved one". You feel the dopamine from your dreams rushing through your body as you throw your jizz sock on the floor. It's time to change this. Fridays nights is not going to be "me night" any more. It's going to be LOVE NIGHT!

          <h2>2. Swiping</h2>
        </header>

        <p>
          With high hopes it's time to start swiping. Getting a match is hard. <a href="https://medium.com/@worstonlinedater/tinder-experiments-ii-guys-unless-you-are-really-hot-you-are-probably-better-off-not-wasting-your-2ddf370a6e9a">Research</a> has shown that 78 % of [good looking] women match with the top 20 % guys (good looking too of course). Being the rest of those 80 %, you keep swiping through the 22 % batch of deparate and ugly girls that might give you attention.
        </p>

        <p>
          As you swipe you see her. That girls that make severy limb tingle. Her summer freckles, the ocean blue eyes, hair like a golden water fall and the smile like a thousand suns. You throw her a superlike.

            <h2>3. Matching</h2>
          </header>

          <p>
            Yes, it actually does happen. At times. You got yourself a match. Now you need to Google tips and pick-up lines to maybe get her off. That is, if you are not a 2019 casanova like the author of this text.

          <p>
            To be able to land a date with this woman you need all things on this list.

            <ol>
              <li>Attractiveness</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>4. The Date</h2>
      </header>

      <p>
        When you've successfully won her heart on the internet it is time to attempt it in real life too. I actually do not know how to go from here as I have yet to go on a date with a girl from Tinder. I am sorry.

      <p>
        This might help though.
